<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I just came across a neat <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/29/ai-is-about-to-go-mainstream-and-reshape-the-workplace/">TechCrunch article</a>&nbsp;by Michael Yamnitsky about the roles that AI is currently playing in the business ecosystem. They produced a graphic to show the current landscape which I have reproduced below:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/ai-chart-final-option2.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=762" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="475" src="https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/ai-chart-final-option2.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=762" width="640" /></a></div><br />Here we see a literal invasion of AI applications chipping away at many facets of normal business processes. It seems pretty clear to me that these applications will win over workloads in each of their subdomains. What will get really interesting is when they start getting linked together. More and more will get automated until eventually some amalgamation of software may essentially form a startup (or perhaps a P&amp;L branch) and execute that business with little human involvement!<br /><br />Another interesting point that the article brings up is that many the new crop of AI applications are being subscribed to not by the corporate entity but as time-savers for the workers themselves. Although not explicitly referred to in the article, this seems like it could be amenable to the powerful B2C2B models. Where applications are useful to the worker, and once the worker has adopted it then the business proper is compelled to adopt it.
