<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">So many exciting things are happening in AI these days. The things that used to be philosophy have in some cases move through a research stage, an applications stage, and are now entering a "platform" stage. I just read a <a href="https://go.forrester.com/">Forrester</a> report on the state of text analytics platforms by Boris Evelson.<br /><br />Enterprise application developers naturally see a lot of potential in harnessing unstructured text to improve business processes. Use cases include predictive analytics, where data from unstructured text is used as a signal to predict something salient, to customer feedback analysis, to knowledge discovery to enhance search capabilities. There are many more, and no doubt more to come. For some use cases there are products that more-or-less work out of the box. For most of these though it seems you really want a solutions provider that can stitch together the right pieces for you. IBM, Clarabridge, SAS, Digital Reasoning, HPE, and Attivio lead the pack in terms of offerings and market share.<br /><br /></div>
