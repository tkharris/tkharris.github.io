Here are some projects that I have worked on below:

Probabilistic Context-Free Grammer Tool
____________________________________________

This is software written in C++ that can
* read and write phoenix grammar files
* convert CFGs to Chomsky Normal FOrm
* train rule probabilities for CFGs
* compute n-grams for CFGs

<p>
<a href="cfg2ngram-0.1.tgz">Download</a><br>

The software is free, no warranty applies. Use at your own risk. Yada-yada...

</p>

It is no doubt quite buggy and poorly documented. Check back later or
email <a href="mailto:tkharris@cs.cmu.edu">the author</a> for more
information. The paper: <a href="Project2.doc"><i>Bi-grams Generated
from Phoenix Grammars and Sparse Data for the Universal Speech
Interface</i></a> (the program now works for any n although it might
take a millennia to finish) and a Powerpoint <a
href="pcfg.ppt">presentation</a> will provide some background.
